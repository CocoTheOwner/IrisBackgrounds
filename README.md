1. Clone this repository anywhere on your PC
2. Right-click your desktop and select "personalize"
3. Select the cloned folder under the Backgrounds section
4. Set the mode to "centre", it appears to give the best results *Feel free to try other modes!*
5. Set the refresh time to anything. I personally use 5 minutes.
6. Enjoy over 80 (and counting) screenshots every time you see your desktop!
